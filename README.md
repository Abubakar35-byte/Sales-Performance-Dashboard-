## Process 
- Data Collection
Imported raw sales data from Excel (Superstore dataset).
Data included fields like Order Date, Sales, Profit, Quantity, Category, and Region.
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
Removed duplicates and null values.
Standardized date formats and column names.
Created new calculated columns (like Profit Margin and Year of Order Date).
- Data Analysis
Used formulas such as SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, and growth rate calculations.
Analyzed Year-over-Year (YoY) growth for Sales, Profit, and Orders.
- Data Visualization
Designed an interactive dashboard in Excel using:
Charts (Column, Line, Doughnut, Bar).
Slicers for filtering by Year, Region, and Segment.
Applied a blue & purple gradient theme for a modern, professional look.
- Insights & Reporting
Identified top-performing subcategories (Phones & Chairs).
Highlighted regional sales trends and profit performance.
Calculated growth metrics and profitability ratios to support decision-making.

Orders increased by 28.64%, and quantity sold rose by 27.45%, suggesting stronger customer demand.
- Profit Margin Concern:
Despite higher sales, profit margin dropped by 5.15%, hinting at increased costs or discounting strategies.
- Top Categories:
Technology contributed the highest profit ($286K), while Furniture and Office Supplies followed closely.
-Regional Performance:
Western states generated the most sales, with California leading at $457K, making it the top-performing region.
- Top Subcategories:
Phones and Chairs emerged as the most profitable subcategories, driving overall revenue growth.

## Conclusion
The Sales Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of business performance by analyzing sales, profit, and order trends. The data reveals a strong year-over-year growth in sales and orders, indicating a steady increase in customer demand. However, the declining profit margin suggests a need to optimize costs and pricing strategies. Technology products generated the highest profits, while the Western region, particularly California, led in total sales. Overall, this analysis highlights key growth opportunities and helps management make data-driven decisions to improve profitability and regional performance.
